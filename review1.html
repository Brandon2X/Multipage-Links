   <p> This fight was for the lightweight IBF championship, this was Teofimo's first 
       championship bout and Teo delivered here. First round was Teo figuring out his
       distance and feeling out Richard Commey's power because at this time Commey had 26 KO's.
       When the second round began Teofimo started landing more flushing shots that were effective 
       and then, BOOM!!! Teo caught Commey with a big right hand, Commey went down and although got back 
       up was clearly not fit to continue fighting so the ref stopped the match.
