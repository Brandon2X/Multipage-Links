    <p>This made Teofimo Lopez the undisputed lightweight champion of the world! 
        He had all four belts. And honestly when I first watched this fight I thought he lost but 
        after watching it a couple more times he definetly did win that fight he had really 
        good countering skills and put the pressure on Lomachenko. This fight made Teofimo Lopez the 
        king of the lightweight division.
